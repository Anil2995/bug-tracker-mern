Please capture screenshots of your running application and save them in this folder with the following names:

1.  **Dashboard** -> `dashboard.png`
2.  **Project List** -> `project-list.png`
3.  **Kanban Board** -> `kanban.png`
4.  **Ticket Details Modal** -> `ticket-details.png`
5.  **File Upload** -> `upload.png`
6.  **Comments Section** -> `comments.png`
7.  **Filter & Search** -> `filter.png`

Once you save these files here, run:
